### **High-Level Requirements (HLR)  
1. **Frequency Range:** The design should support polarization conversion within the 4â€“8 GHz band.  
2. **Polarization Modes:** The system must convert between linear and circular polarizations effectively.  
3. **Multiband Functionality:** It should support multiple frequency bands in the specified range.  
4. **Reconfigurability:** Incorporate mechanisms to dynamically adjust polarization states.  
5. **Reflective Design:** Ensure the metasurface reflects electromagnetic waves with high efficiency and low loss.  
6. **Performance Metrics:** Achieve high polarization conversion efficiency, wideband operation, and high reflectivity.  
7. **Applications:** The design must be suitable for satellite communications, radar systems, and 5G networks.  

### Low-Level Requirements (LLR)  
1. **Material and Substrate:**  
   - Use a high-dielectric constant substrate (e.g., Rogers RT/duroid or FR4).  
   - Employ conductive layers (e.g., copper or gold) for reflection.  

2. **Unit Cell Design:**  
   - Create periodic structures optimized for multiband response.  
   - Include reconfigurable elements like PIN diodes, varactor diodes, or MEMS switches.  

3. **Control System:**  
   - Implement a compact and low-power control circuit for tuning reconfigurable elements.  
   - Provide dynamic adjustability for polarization states and frequency bands.  

4. **Simulation and Testing:**  
   - Use CST Microwave Studio or HFSS for electromagnetic simulation and design validation.  
   - Perform reflection coefficient and polarization tests using a network analyzer and anechoic chamber.  

5. **Performance Metrics:**  
   - Achieve a polarization conversion ratio (PCR) of >90% across the operating frequency bands.  
   - Maintain insertion loss <1 dB for high reflectivity.  
   - Support beam steering capability for enhanced adaptability.  

6. **Environmental Considerations:**  
   - Design for robustness in different operating environments (e.g., temperature, humidity).  
   - Use materials that sustain performance under satellite communication and radar conditions.  

7. **Power and Integration:**  
   - Minimize power consumption of reconfigurable elements (<5 W per module).  
   - Ensure compatibility with existing communication infrastructure.
