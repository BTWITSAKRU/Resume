#### **mini project outcome:**
#### **In our simulation using Ansys 2024, we designed a metasurface with dimensions of 10x10 mm and a thickness of 1.6 mm. The objective was to create a structure capable of efficiently controlling polarization without the need for complex feeding techniques. The results from the simulation indicated that the metasurface exhibited three distinct linear polarization bands, as well as a near-circular polarization band, demonstrating its effectiveness in converting linearly polarized electromagnetic waves into circular polarization across specific frequency ranges**
