#### **supervisor name:Dr padmaja**
#### **cluster name: communication**
#### **mini project outcome:**
#### **In our simulation using Ansys 2024, we designed a metasurface with dimensions of 10x10 mm and a thickness of 1.6 mm. The objective was to create a structure capable of efficiently controlling polarization without the need for complex feeding techniques. The results from the simulation indicated that the metasurface exhibited three distinct linear polarization bands, as well as a near-circular polarization band, demonstrating its effectiveness in converting linearly polarized electromagnetic waves into circular polarization across specific frequency ranges**
#### **The capability to achieve multi-band performance, combined with the flexibility in polarization control, positions this metasurface as a highly promising candidate for next-generation technologies. Its design simplicity, compact size, and adaptability make it ideal for use in a wide range of advanced applications, from 5G communication networks to remote sensing and military-grade radar systems. With further iterations and optimizations, this design can be tailored to meet the evolving demands of modern technology, ensuring robust and efficient performance across diverse operational environments.**
